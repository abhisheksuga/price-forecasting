# price-forecasting
This project explores the use of deep learning models, particularly LSTM, for forecasting commodity prices, with a focus on gold. The dataset includes historical gold prices, enhanced with lag features and technical indicators. The goal is to evaluate the effectiveness of LSTM for price prediction in comparison to other methods.
